Analysis of phone bank pick-up rates and variables

The question we want to answer is this: what factors enhance the probability of someone answering a phone call? Using the date, we can look at the effect of the day of the week as well as if calling close to a holiday reduces the pick-up chance. We can also test for the effect of the time of day and the area code. Finally, we can look at the effect of the department.
